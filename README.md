# Project title
GEP survey data cleaning 

## Description
The Gender Equality Plan (GEP) monitoring survey cleaning script contains R code for cleaning the INSPIRE survey data. The INSPIRE survey targeted 27 EU member plus Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, and the UK. Survey is launched in 2024. Data cleaning was conducted using STATA; however, to promote transparency and reproducibility, we aim to publish the analysis code in R. Due to data protection regulations, the survey data cannot be publicly shared. The data cleaning script is based on the <strong>D3.3 Report on GEP Monitoring Survey and Webcrawl Results</strong>. The report can be accessed via the following link: <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/14264597" target="_blank">https://zenodo.org/records/14264597</a>.  

INSPIRE is an EU funded project. INSPIRE is Europe's Centre of Excellence on inclusive gender equality in research and innovation. It brings together cutting-edge knowledge, ambitious policy approaches, and innovative practices to provide a gateway for scholars, equality experts, practitioners and trainers to connect and share resources, as well as co-create new ones.
